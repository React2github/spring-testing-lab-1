# Spring Testing Lab 1

## Instructions

You will be adding a new endpoint in the project we started building in the
previous lesson. Create an endpoint in your controller called `/reverse`

    - Make it take a string as a parameter
    - Make it return the reverse of that string
    - Create unit tests to make sure your method works with uppercase, lowercase, mixed case, spaces and words with numbers in them
    - Remove the endpoint mapping from your endpoint
    - Ensure that your unit tests still pass
